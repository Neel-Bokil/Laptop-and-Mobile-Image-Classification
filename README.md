## ðŸ“‘ Laptop and Mobile Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains the code and project documentation for a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based image classification model developed to distinguish between images of **Laptops** and **Mobiles**. The project was built as part of my internship at **INFOLABZ IT SERVICES PVT. LTD.** during my 7th semester for Gujarat Technological University.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

* Collect image data for **Laptop** and **Mobile** classes.
* Build a CNN model capable of classifying images into these two categories.
* Implement real-time image capture using OpenCV and test classification predictions on unseen images.

The project workflow involved:

* Image Data Preparation (organized into **training**, **validation**, and **testing** folders)
* CNN model development using Keras and TensorFlow
* Real-time image capture via webcam using OpenCV
* Image classification with output labels displaying **Laptop** or **Mobile**

## ðŸ“Š Description of Code

* **Data Preparation:** Organized images into respective folders for training, validation, and testing.
* **OpenCV Scripts:** Scripts to:

  * Open the webcam feed.
  * Capture images in both color and grayscale modes.
  * Save captured images for model training and testing.
* **CNN Model Code:**

  * Built using Keras' Sequential API.
  * Trained the model on the prepared image dataset.
  * Evaluated model accuracy and performance.
  * Predicted image labels for the testing set images.

## ðŸ“‘ Report

A detailed report describing the **internship tasks**, **daily activities**, **data analytics work**, **machine learning experiments**, and this CNN project is included in the repository as a **PDF file**.

> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** The **complete CNN project code and its output screenshots** can be found towards the **end of the PDF report**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

* Expanding the dataset for better model generalization.
* Integrating additional image categories.
* Deploying the model as a simple web application or mobile app for live predictions.
